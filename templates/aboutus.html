        <h2>Our Beliefs</h2><br>
        <p>At Home Tutoring.com, we believe that every student deserves a personal tutor, and we are dedicated to promoting equity, opportunity, and achievement for all learners. To that end, we partner with colleges and universities, K–12 schools and districts, public and state libraries, employee benefits programs, 1-to-1 tutoring and homework help in more than 250 subjects.</p>
        <br><p>Over more than two decades of supporting students, educators, school leaders, and families, we have helped institutions increase student pass and persistence rates, and learners become more confident in their schoolwork. Our learner satisfaction rates remain consistently high: 97 percent of post-session survey respondents would recommend Tutor.com to a friend, and 98 percent are glad their institution offers Tutor.com. The feeling is mutual. We are honored to partner with institutions and organizations to help them scale the human connection and provide individualized support—anytime, anywhere.</p>
        <br><h2>Our Story</h2><br>
        <p>In 1998, a small group of passionate education and tech professionals had a terrific URL and a big idea—use the Internet to connect students to tutors whenever and wherever they needed help. So, they recruited about a hundred tutors and created one of the first online, interactive classrooms.</p><br>
        <p>In 2000, Home Tutoring.com, Inc. was incorporated and began partnering with institutions to ensure that students from all socioeconomic backgrounds would have access to highly effective 1-to-1 tutoring and homework help, day or night, from any Internet-enabled device.</p><br>
        <p>In 2014, Home Tutoring.com acquired The Princeton Review®, a world leader in education services, and added The Princeton Review test preparation services to its online tutoring platform and offerings.</p><br>
